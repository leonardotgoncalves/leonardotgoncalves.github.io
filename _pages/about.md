Hi! I am Leonardo Gon√ßalves, an evolutionary biologist from Porto Alegre, Brazil.

I am currently a PhD candidate at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) and a visiting student at Royal Holloway, University of London (UK). During my PhD, my primary focus revolves around mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) evolution, using bumblebees (_Bombus_) as a study sytem. Besides evaluating the utility of mtDNA in bee phylogenetics and identification, I want to unravel its role in climatic niche adaptation of Neotropical species and the intriguing transition to social parasitism in cuckoo bumblebees.

As someone with a passion for integrative evolutionary biology, I look forward to combine observational studies, physiology, and bioinformatics in my upcoming projects!
